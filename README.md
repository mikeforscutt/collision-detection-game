# Collision Detection JavaScript Game

## Overview

Welcome to the Collision Detection JavaScript Game project! This project is designed to showcase a modern JavaScript game that includes collision detection for various shapes, including circles, triangles, and squares, within an HTML5 canvas. Whether you're a game developer or a JavaScript enthusiast, this project provides a solid foundation for creating games with accurate collision mechanics.

## Features

- **Shape-Based Collision Detection**: The game incorporates collision detection for three fundamental shapes: circles, triangles, and squares.

- **Canvas Rendering**: Utilizes the HTML5 canvas element for rendering the game graphics, providing an efficient and visually appealing gaming experience.

- **Interactive Gameplay**: Players can interact with the shapes, move them around the canvas, and observe how collision detection works in real-time.

- **Modern JavaScript**: Written in modern JavaScript, the project demonstrates best practices for structuring and organizing game code.
