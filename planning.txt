Collision Detection
Given the 2D coordinates and dimensions of multiple objects on a 2D plane. We want to determine if any of these objects intersect or occupy the same space.
Bonus points if the solution allows for 3D coordinates and/or supports different shapes.

While seeing the business logic (using JavaScript) would be important, seeing a visual representation as well would be welcome.

The shapes and their coordinates can be randomly generated or user-provided. No specific requirement on the structure you should use for the solution or for defining a shape – can be as simple as an array [[0,0],[1,0],[0,1],[1,1]] to define a square of width ‘1’ – I want to be able to see a solution that can be run and verified that it calculates the result correctly.

1.) As a user, I want to see if any shapes on the canvas collide
2.) As a user, I want to add a selected shape to the canvas
3.) When a shape collides with another shape, change colour of the shape
4.) If all of the shapes collide display message to user 

Create a function to add a shape (could have a little form to determine form shape from a select box), width, height inputs, with button and on click add the shape.

Add function to detect collision, on page load to detect whats already there, then onclick of the add button to run the check after the shape is added. If it is, then alter the colour.

Create 3rd function to test if all collided and if so show error message to user.
